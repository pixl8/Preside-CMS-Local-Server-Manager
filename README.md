Preside-CMS-Local-Server-Manager
================================

A Desktop GUI application enabling developers to efficiently manage their local PresideCMS site instances

**Currently in development** - Completely unusable right now. This readme will be updated when ready.

## Running locally

Currently, there's a shell script in the root of the project named **runlocal.sh**. This should work on both OSX and Linux (only tested on Linux Mint). There is also a **runlocal.bat** file for Windows users.

For the run script to work, you will need to have downloaded [Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) binaries, unpacked locally and added the unpacked folder to your path. Once we have a proper build, users of the software will not need to do this :)
